## 1. Project Title
### Beijing Air Quality Analysis – Interactive Power BI Dashboard

## 2. Description
This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed and interactive analysis of Beijing’s air quality by visualizing key pollutant concentrations, temperature patterns, and humidity variations across different months. The report transforms complex environmental data into clear insights, helping users understand seasonal behavior, pollutant fluctuations, and weather conditions that influence air quality. Through intuitive visuals such as bar charts, KPIs, line graphs, and interactive slicers, the dashboard highlights critical environmental indicators including Ozone, Indium Oxide, Sulphur, Benzene, CO(GT), Nitrous Oxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide. It also identifies important metrics such as the hottest day and most humid day in the dataset. This project demonstrates strong analytical reporting, data modeling, and visualization skills using Power BI, making it ideal for environmental analysis, portfolio presentation, academic work, or research.

## 3. Tech Stack
-- Power BI Desktop  
-- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
-- Power Query (M Language)  
-- Excel/CSV for data preprocessing  
-- Custom Power BI Theme & UI Design  

## 4. Data Source
The dataset includes environmental sensor readings collected in Beijing across multiple timestamps. It contains pollutant metrics such as Ozone, Indium Oxide, Sulphur, CO(GT), Benzene, Nitrous Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Non-Methane hydrocarbons. Weather indicators such as temperature, absolute humidity, relative humidity, and date-time stamps are also included. The data was cleaned, structured, and transformed to create a reliable foundation for accurate reporting and analysis.

## 5. Features / Highlights

## Dashboard Highlights
-- KPI cards showing total pollutant values for Ozone, Indium Oxide, Sulphur, Absolute Humidity, Benzene, and CO(GT)  
-- Identification of the hottest day and most humid day using calculated DAX measures
